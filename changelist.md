### New Features

1. App remembers which files you opened so you don't have to open them each time
2. Can "bind" so that you don't have to select the neuron and layer on each dataset viewer individually
3. There are now 2 views:
   - "By Neuron" (the original)
   - "By Image" (see top neurons for an image)
