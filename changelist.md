## Update Instructions:

1. Close the app if it is currently running
2. Download the .dmg file from the latest release
3. Drag the .dmg file to your Applications folder
4. Reveal the app in Finder and right click it and select "open" to bypass Apple's "malicious software" warning (will fix this later)

### New Features

- Added version to window title
- Cosmetic improvements
- "load" button disabled until data folder is chosen
- display the first top image for each neuron

### Bug Fixes

- App should now be "signed" so it can opened on Macs without additional steps
- App no longer prompts you to update if your version is newer than the one on GitHub
- Fixed neuron choice box index (1-50 instead of 0-50)
