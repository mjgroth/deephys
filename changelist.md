## Update Instructions:

1. Close the app if it is currently running
2. Download the .dmg file from the latest release
3. Drag the .dmg file to your Applications folder
4. Reveal the app in Finder and right click it and select "open" to bypass Apple's "malicious software" warning (will fix this later)

### New Features

- Show all 100 images for each neuron

### Bug Fixes
- Switched from `.dmg` to `.app` to hopefully bypass "malicious software" issue
- Fixed crash at startup when running on other Macs
