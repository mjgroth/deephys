Welcome to the Deephys Docs!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the documentation for the neural activity visualizer accompanying the paper ___

For an introduction to the project, see our `homepage <https://deephys.org/>`_

The project is divided into two parts: the visualizer and a tool to export your data into the visualizer

If you'd like to jump right in and try out the visualizer, please see the :doc:`../quickstart` guide. The app contains download links to pre-generated data so you can quickly try out the features and see some cool data.

To quickly start generating data from your own deep learning pipeline, see the :doc:`export guides <../export/index>`

For more advanced tutorials, please explore the pages listed on the left.

If you'd like to contribute, please see the :doc:`../contrib/index` guide
