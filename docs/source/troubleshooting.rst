If you think your user settings or state may be corrupt, they can be reset. There is a button in the app settings to do this. But if you cannot open the app, it is also possible to do this from the command line. While executing the app from the command line, you can add the argument ``reset`` to reset everything as if you have just downloaded the app for the first time.
