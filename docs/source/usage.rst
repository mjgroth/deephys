Exporting up your data 
=============

Before starting, install our Deephys exporter Python library. This library facilitates encapsulating your data into a format compatible with Deephys and saves the data to files.

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install deephys

Now, let's get started exporting your data  🚀

☀️ Defining Your Model
--------------------------------------

We first need to define the model to visualize. Any number of layers can be included. To define the model indicate its name, the neuron count per layer, and which layer is the classification layer.

.. code-block:: python

  import deephys as dp
  
  dp_model = dp.model(
    name = "my_net",
    layers = { # include any additional layers
        "penultimate_layer": num_neurons_layer,
        "output": num_neurons_output,
     },
     classification_layer = "output"
  )
  dp_model.save()
    
This will create a ``my_net.model`` to be imported into Deephys.

🎏 Export each dataset distributions separately 🎏
--------------------------------------

Each dataset distribution that you would like to analyze needs to be exported separately. After exporting all dataset distributions, you can visualize them together using Deephys 🪄.  

🤔 How to export one dataset distribution? It is just the following 2 steps:

1. Extract images 🖼️, categories 🐕, and neural activity 🔥🔥🔥
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is all the variables we need for each data distribution:

- ``images``: They need to be in the range [0, 1]. It is advisable to resize them to a small size (eg. 64x64 pixels) to save space and memory. They can be color or grayscale images. Dimensions: ``[#images,#channels,H,W]``.
- ``groundtruth_categories``: Integer indicating the ground-truth label number. Dimensions: ``[#images]``.
- ``caregory_names``: Strings indicating the name of each category. Dimensions: ``[#categories]``.
- ``network_output``: For each image, extract the output of the network (after or before the softmax, it is up to you). Dimensions: ``[#images, #categories]``.
- ``neural_activity``: For each image, extract the neural activity that you want to visualize. This can be obtained for as many layers as you want. If you want to visualize a convolutional layer or a transformer, please see this for options (TBD). Dimensions for each layer: ``[#images, #neurons]``.

All these can be Python lista or a numpy arrays. 

🤯 IMPORTANT: Make sure that the order of the images is aligned with the neural activity.

2. Convert the data to a Deephys-compatible format ✨
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to convert the data in a Deephys-compatible format. Just plug all the variables obtained in step 1 to our Deephys export function in the following format:

.. code-block:: python

  test = dp.import_test_data(
      name = "Data_Distribution_1",
      pixel_data = images,
      ground_truths = groundtruth_categories,
      classes = caregory_names,
      state = [neural_activity, network_output],
      model = dp_model
    )
  test.save()

Note that ``dp_model`` is the model that was defined at the beginning of the process. This will create a file called ``Data_Distribution_1.test``, which can visualized in Deephys.

You can add more layers to the visualization by just adding them in the state list.

🤯 IMPORTANT: Make sure that the list passed to ``state`` follow the same order as when defining the model  in ``layers``.

🎏 Remember to follow step 1 and 2 for each dataset distribution separately. This will generate a different visualization file for each distribution that can then be visualized in Deephys all together.
