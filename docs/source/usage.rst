Exporting up your data 
=============

Before starting, install our Deephys-Exporter Python library. This library facilitates encapsulating your data into a format compatible with Deephys and saves the data to files.

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install deephys

Now, let's get started exporting your data  üöÄ

‚òÄÔ∏è Defining Your Model
--------------------------------------

We first need to define the model to visualize. Any number of layers can be included. To define the model indicate its name, the neuron count per layer, and which layer is the classification layer.:: 

>>> import deephys as dp
>>> model = dp.model(
    name = "my_net",
    layers = {
    # include any additional layers
      "penultimate_layer": num_neurons_layer,
      "output": num_neurons_output,
      },
      classification_layer = "output"
    )
>>> model.save()
    
This will create a `my_net.model` to be imported into Deephys.

üéè Export each dataset distributions separately üéè
--------------------------------------

Each dataset distribution that you would like to analyze needs to be exported separately. After exporting all dataset distributions, you can visualize them together using Deephys ü™Ñ.  

ü§î How to export one dataset distribution? It is just the following 2 steps:

1. Extract images üñºÔ∏è, categories üêï, and neural activity from the network üî•üî•üî•
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is all what you need:

- ``images`` üñºÔ∏è: It is advisable to resize them to a small size (eg. 64x64 pixels) to save sapce. Dimensions: [#images,#channels,H,W].
- ``groundtruth_categories`` üêï: Integer indicating the ground-truth label number. Dimensions: [#images].
- ``caregory_names`` üéà: Strings indicating the name of each category. Dimensions: [#categories].
- ``network_output`` üî•: For each image, obtain the output of the network (after or before the softmax, it is up to you). Dimensions: [#images, #categories].
- ``neural_activity`` üî•üî•üî•: For each image, obtain the neural activity that you want to visualize. This can be obtained for as many layers as you want. If you want to visualize a convolutional layer or a transformer, please see this for options. Dimensions: [#image, #neurons].

You can keep them in a python list or a numpy array. 

‚ÄºÔ∏è Make sure that the order of the images is kept constant across all the data.

2. Export the data with the Deephys wrapper ‚ú®
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to save. Just plug all the data to our Deephys wrapper in the following format. 

>>> test = deephys.import_test_data(
    name = "OOD",
    pixel_data = images,
    ground_truths = groundtruth_categories,
    classes = caregory_names,
    state = [neural_activity, network_output],
    model = model
    )
>>> test.save()

Note that ``model`` is the model that was created at the beginning. The wrapper create a file called ``OOD.test``, which can used in Deephys.

You can add more layers to the visualization by just adding them in the state list, just make sure `network_output` is the last one.

üéè Remember to follow step 1 and 2 for each dataset distribution separately.

.. Extracting Activations From Data

Examples 
--------------------------------------

To extract data from a test, please see the steps provided `here <https://colab.research.google.com/github/mjgroth/deephys-aio/blob/master/Python_Tutorial.ipynb>`_

Here ``act_extract`` function takes dataloader and model as parameters. For example: 

>>> all_activs, all_outputs, all_images, all_cats = act_extract(testloader, models)

Here ``all_activs`` is the 2D float array of neurons and activations of the penultimate layer.

``all_outputs`` is the 2D float array of neurons and logits for the classification layer.

``all_outputs`` is an ordered list of image pixel data [images,channels,dim1,dim2] containing information of all images of testloader.

``all_cats`` is an ordered list of ground truths.

Generating Data For Deephys
---------------------------
you can use the :py:func:`deephys.deephys.import_test_data` function:

Parameter ``name`` in :func:`deephys.deephys.import_test_data` should be a string containing i.e. the name of the dataset.

Parameter ``state`` in :func:`deephys.deephys.import_test_data` should be a 3D float array layers, neurons, and activations respectively.

Parameter ``classes`` in :func:`deephys.deephys.import_test_data` should be an ordered list of strings representing class names.

Parameter ``model`` in :func:`deephys.deephys.import_test_data` should be the model structure.

Parameter ``pixel_data`` in :func:`deephys.deephys.import_test_data` should be an ordered list of image pixel data [images,channels,dim1,dim2].

Parameter ``ground_truths`` in :func:`deephys.deephys.import_test_data` should be an ordered list of ground truths.

Please see `here <https://github.com/mjgroth/deephys-aio/blob/master/Python_Tutorial.ipynb>`_ for the full tutorial
